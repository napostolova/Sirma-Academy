    <p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin
        literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney
        College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and
        going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum
        comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by
        Cicero, written in 45 BC.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by
        the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that
        are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is
        the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to
        distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able
        to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances
        and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to
        be repudiated and annoyances accepted. </p>

    <p>All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the
        first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of
        model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is
        therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.</p>
