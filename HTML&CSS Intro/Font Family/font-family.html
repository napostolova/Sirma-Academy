    <p>Contrary to popular belief, <strong>Lorem Ipsum</strong> is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of
        classical Latin
        literature from <i>45</i> BC, making it over <i>2000</i> years old. <u>Richard McClintock</u>, a Latin professor
        at Hampden-Sydney
        College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and
        going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum
        comes from sections <i>1.10.33</i> and <i>1.10.33</i> of "de <b>Finibus Bonorum et Malorum</b>" (The Extremes of
        Good and Evil) by
        Cicero, written in <i>45 </i> BC.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by
        the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that
        are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is
        the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to
        distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able
        to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances
        and owing to the claims of duty or the <em>obligations of business</em> it will frequently occur that pleasures
        have to
        be repudiated and annoyances accepted. </p>
